      <h3> 9/10 Excellent</h3>
<p>The Simpsons and a family who lives in Springfield .
The Simpsons is one of the best TV shows of all times.
You could watch each episode 20 times and never get tired .
 They will experience twists and turns throughout the seasons which are as funny as each other that are mostly quite funny and others terrifying .
 The show's animation is fantastic.
And the voice acting is exceptional bringing the dysfunctional family to life.
Some warchers argue that the show went downhill, rapidly after about the 10th.
The Simpons was an amazing show until after season 6 and then was still good until around season 12.</p>

<h3> 10/10 Best Show on Earth</h3>
<p>The Simpsons is outrageously phenomenal!!!!!! If I hear someone say something bad about that show, I'll hunt them down and make them pay for what they did!
I have not seen one bad episode of The Simpsons, and I've seen 184 of them! There are over 50 characters in the show,
not one of them short from excellent. 
It is the only TV show I make a point to sit down and watch.</p>

<h3>9/10
A great show, despite declining in quality over the years</h3>
<p>When I was 10, I adored the Simpsons, America's favourite dysfunctional family. Me and my brother and sisters watched it every day after school, and got a bagful of laughs. Two years ago though, I stopped watching it. Maybe I didn't find it as funny, creative or as original anymore. Well after seeing the Simpsons Movie, I decided to give the show another chance. And I am glad I did, because it is smart, creative, funny AND original. It is true that the show has been declining in written quality the past three years or so, but the more recent seasons are still watchable, thanks to the animation and the endearing characters.

The show's animation is fantastic. In animated shows, I like animation that is colourful and fluid, and the animation in this show is exactly that. The theme tune is irresistibly catchy and the story lines are outstandingly good. Other than the voice acting what made the show so good was its writing. Not obnoxious or childish, but smart and most importantly funny. And the visual jokes are also impressive. - CUT DUE TO BEING TOO LONG

<h3>8/10
Is this it ? Just "MEH" from now on</h3>
<p>I grew up with The Simpons. It was my favourite time of the day.

As I got older, I continued watching and rewatching and rerewatching again.

I started feeling "MEH" about the show when the movie came out. I did not like it, what the hell was that all about?

And the seasons after the movie... well... Let's just say you could definitely see a difference.
