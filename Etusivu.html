      <h3> 9/10 Excellent</h3>
The Simpsons and a family who lives in Springfield .
The Simpsons is one of the best TV shows of all times.
You could watch each episode 20 times and never get tired .
 They will experience twists and turns throughout the seasons which are as funny as each other that are mostly quite funny and others terrifying .
 The show's animation is fantastic.
And the voice acting is exceptional bringing the dysfunctional family to life.
Some warchers argue that the show went downhill, rapidly after about the 10th.
The Simpons was an amazing show until after season 6 and then was still good until around season 12.

<h3> 10/10 Best Show on Earth</h3>
The Simpsons is outrageously phenomenal!!!!!! If I hear someone say something bad about that show, I'll hunt them down and make them pay for what they did!
I have not seen one bad episode of The Simpsons, and I've seen 184 of them! There are over 50 characters in the show,
not one of them short from excellent. 
It is the only TV show I make a point to sit down and watch.
